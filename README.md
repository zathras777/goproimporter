GoPro Timelapse Import Script

This script automates the importing of sequences of JPEG images taken
using a GoPro camera. The images are generated using a sensible filename
but they are often spread across several different directories, so this
script tries to make sense of them and extract them into a single
directory with sequential file names to make creating the timelapse movie
simpler.

It requires the PIL library.

Simple usage:

  ./gopro_importer.py --dest ~/destination --prefix hello /mounted/gopro

This will look for timelapse sequences and give you the option to extract
each in turn, storing the images it copies using the filenames

   /destination/hello_n/xxxxxxxx.JPG

where 'n' is the number of the timelapse and xxxxxxxx is the 8 digit sequence
number.

NB Use at your own risk!
